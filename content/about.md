I am a data scientist and compliance professional with strong experience in advanced analytics, machine learning, and financial crime prevention. Currently, I serve as **Subgerente Adjunto de Cumplimiento** at **Banco de Crédito BCP**, where I design and implement **anti–money laundering (AML)** scenarios, build **fraud detection models**, and deploy scalable solutions using **Azure Databricks**, **MLflow**, and modern data platforms.

Previously, I worked as a **Data Analyst at Farmacias Peruanas**, analyzing large datasets to uncover patterns, anomalies, and business insights that supported strategic decision-making. Earlier, as a **Data Science Intern at SIDERPERU**, I developed cloud-based data solutions—such as data lakes on AWS—and built machine learning products to optimize resources, improve production planning, and strengthen sales strategies.

My experience also includes working as a **Data Scientist at Vida Software SAC**, where I developed statistical models and performed data preprocessing to segment clients by distributor location.
